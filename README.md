### Exercise 1: Count Button Clicks
#### Step 1
1) Create an HTML page with the ```Score: 0``` in large letters.
2) Add a button to that HTML page.
3) Create a javascript page that will add 1 to the number when the HTML button is pressed.

#### Step 2
1) Include another button to input a different score for player 2
2) Include a reset button to reset the scores of both players.

#### BONUS Challenges
1) Once either player reaches 5, stop the game.
2) Display ```YOU WIN PLAYER (1/2)``` when one of the players reaches 5 clicks.
3) Clear everything when the user hits reset.

### Exercise 2: Crazy Typewriter
1) Create a simple html form with a textarea form field, and a reset button
2) When the User clicks the reset button, any text already in the textarea should be cleared/erased
3) As the User types, make it so they always enter a set sentence no matter what letters they actually type (each to the User presses a key, your JavaScript should add the next character from your hardcoded sentence to the textarea just as if they typed it).

#### BONUS CHALLENGES:
* Start with a list containing multiple canned sentences and randomly pick a sentence when the User resets the form
